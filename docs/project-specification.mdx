# Sleekflow Full Stack Software Engineer Project

## Objective

Develop a scalable and well-designed TODO list web application that allows users to manage their TODOs, demonstrating your full stack development skills, API design expertise, and software engineering best practices.

## Project Overview

### TODO List Web Application

#### Backend API (Python FastAPI Server with SQLModel)

- **TODOs CRUD**
- **Each TODO has:**
  - Unique ID
  - Name
  - Description
  - Due Date
  - Status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
  - priority
  - tags
- Filtering (by status, due date, tags)
- Sorting (e.g., by due date, status, name)

#### Frontend UI (Next.js)

- Responsive design
- User interface for managing TODOs (create, update, delete, filter, sort)
- Real-time collaboration (e.g., shared TODO lists, activity feeds)

#### Must-have Features

- **Team features**
  - User authentication and registration (BetterAuth)
  - Authorization (e.g., role-based access control using ABAC Implementation)
- DevOps (CI/CD pipeline, Docker)
- Architecture diagram

## Design Requirements

### Technical Design

- Adhere to SOLID principles
- Use Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Ensure code and design consistency

### API Design

- Use clear and consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper model mapping (TypeScript in front-end, Python dataclasses in back-end)

### Documentation

- Include README with instructions for setup and usage
- Document API endpoints and functionality

## Deliverables

- Create docker-compose for both front-end and back-end servers.

## Guidelines

- This Project is a mono-repo including both front-end (/frontend) and back-end (/backend).
- Use Python with FastAPI for the backend API development.
- Use Next.js for the front-end framework.
- Use PostgreSQL for storing TODOs and user data.
- Implement error handling and validations for API requests.
- Write unit tests and integration tests for the core functionality (both backend and frontend).
- Ensure your application can be easily run and tested locally.
- Create docker-compose.yml on the outermost layer to init both front-end and back-end applications.
